            - Classifiaction
            
                -- decision_tree_classifier.py
                
                -- knn_classifier.py

            - setup.py
            
            - dist                            
            
                -- wheel file 
                
                -- tar.gz file
        
        ### Installing:
        for installing go to the directory with setup.py and run 
        ```python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel```
        which will generate a dist folder with both wheel file and tar.gz file 
        
        
        ### to use the module
        
        after installing the package to use the modules:
            ` from classification import decision_tree_classifier`
        
        after cleaning and feature engineering the data
        send the data as arguments as X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test data in sequence
        
        - decision_tree_classifier(X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test) 
        
        - knn_classification( n, X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test ) # here n is for the neighbours
        
        - logistic_regression( X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test )
        
        - svm_classifiaction( X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test )
