# python Packaging
this repository is based on packaging in python 

# what is packaging
A python package is a directory of python modules(files are also modules) with a file named __init__.py

example of package structure:

for example consider a project of creating a game:

- an alternate for packaging, you should [freeze your application](https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/freezing/#freezing-your-code-ref)

# how to create a package
[example_of a_sample_package]()
example how to create a package with some Python modules:
step1: create a dictionary, The name of this directory will be the name of the package, which we want to create 
step2: This directory needs to contain a file with the name "__init__.py". This file can be empty, or it can contain valid Python code.          This code will be executed when a package will be imported, so it can be used to initialize a package,
step3: Now we can add the Python files and modules into this package 

# types of packaging for distribution 

1. source distribution
2. build distribution


# publish the package in opensource


# create a private repo for internal use
